# Challenge 05 - Day Scheduler

## Description

This weeks challenge is to create a day scheduler. When users visit they site, they are presented with the current day and typical work day blocks. A user can then enter text into an hour-long block and save that activity in local storage. Timed blocks will have a visual color change to indicate the current block, upcoming/yet to happen blocks, and time blocks that already passed.
